# Part 1 Intro and Neuron code
inputs = [1.2, 5.1, 2.1]
weights = [3.1, 2.1, 8.7]
bias = 3

output = inputs[0]*weights[0] + inputs[1]*weights[1] + inputs[2]*weights[2] + bias

# the above code is an example of a neuron. It's composed inputs, weights and bias and it 
# multiplies input by weights then gets all their sum and then adds the bias to get the
# final output
